    "This programming assignment gives you a chance to perform the classification task using neural networks. You will get to build a neural network from scratch and train and test it on a standard classification dataset. Further you will learn different tricks and techniques to train a neural network eficiently by observing few important issues and trying to overcome them. This includes observing the performance of the network for different activation functions and optimization algorithms. We will conclude with implementation of various regularization techniques and ResNet to overcome the problems of overfitting and vanishing gradients."
